# HeyNet

HeyNet is a tool that allows network users and operators to express their intents in their "natural language", and eventually HeyNet should convert what the user says into abstract forms of network tasks.

For now, HeyNet is implemented in Java with the use of Stanford's [CoreNLP](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/CoreNLP) and [Wordnet](https://github.com/wordnet/wordnet).

This is still an ongoing work. I will keep updating things in the next few days.

## Near-future ToDos:
1- Implement unit tests.
2- Implement one of the auto-config tools to help configure and build the code.

## Required tools:
1- Stanford's CoreNLP.
2- WordNet.
